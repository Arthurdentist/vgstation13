changes:
  - rscadd: Added several single use spell books for the spells that didn't previously have single use spellbooks.
  - rscadd: Added a new option avaliable for wizards, the 'Spellbook Bundle'. Wizards can now purchase this bundle for five spell points. In return they get a box with seven completely random single use spellbooks. You can't refund the bundle however.
